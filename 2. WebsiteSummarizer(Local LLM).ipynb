      "CRWLR - Terms of Service & Privacy Policy Analyzer\n",
      "A full-stack cloud-native platform for crawling, summarizing, and analyzing legal documents using AI and NLP.\n",
      "About the Project\n",
      "CRWLR is an innovative solution designed to address the complexity and opacity of legal documents like Terms of Service and Privacy Policies. The platform utilizes advanced AI and NLP techniques to crawl websites, extract legal documents, and provide concise, understandable summaries for users. This capstone project for UMBC delivers intelligent insights that help individuals and businesses make more informed decisions about the services they use.\n",
      "Technical Implementation\n",
      "Frontend\n",
      "Developed a responsive UI using Next.js 15 with Tailwind CSS, integrated Clerk for authentication, and deployed on Vercel.\n",
      "Backend\n",
      "Built robust backend services in FastAPI, featuring Gemini API integration for AI-driven summarization, deployed on Google Cloud Run. Leveraged Typesense for efficient data indexing.\n",
      "Custom Crawler Engine\n",
      "Engineered a custom crawler using BeautifulSoup and Playwright, seamlessly integrated with the RESTful backend.\n",
      "DevOps & Infrastructure\n",
      "Implemented a full CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and designed a secure document processing infrastructure.\n",
      "Challenges & Learnings\n",
      "Challenges:\n",
      "One of the major challenges was designing a robust crawler that could identify and extract the correct legal documents from various website layouts and structures. Another challenge was optimizing the AI processing to provide accurate summaries while managing costs.\n",
      "Learnings:\n",
      "This project deepened my understanding of integrating AI APIs effectively, designing performant crawlers, and building secure document processing pipelines. It also taught me valuable lessons about data indexing and search optimization.\n",
